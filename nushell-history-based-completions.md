# History-Based Command Completion for Nushell

## Overview
I want to implement a custom keybinding in Nushell that triggers a completion menu populated with suggestions from my command history. This system would analyze previously executed commands and offer intelligent completions based on usage patterns.

## Key Difference from Existing Solutions
Unlike comprehensive completion frameworks such as Carapace that provide all possible flags and parameters for a command, this system would exclusively suggest options that I have actually used before. Rather than overwhelming me with every available flag from a command's documentation, it would present a curated list based on my personal usage history. This approach prioritizes practical, personalized completions over exhaustive coverageâ€”if I've never used a particular flag or parameter value, it won't appear in the suggestions.

## Key Features

### Smart History Analysis
The completion system would track and remember:
- Command names and their frequency of use
- Flags and switches used with specific commands
- Parameter values passed to commands
- Pipeline patterns and common command combinations

### Database Integration
- Each command execution in Nushell would trigger a hook
- The hook would parse the executed command into its components
- Command data would be stored in an SQLite database table with fields for:
  - Command name
  - Flags used
  - Parameter values
  - Timestamp
  - Full command string

### Interactive Completion Menu
- A custom keybinding would invoke the completion system
- The system would query the SQLite database for relevant historical data
- Results would be displayed in a custom menu (similar to Nushell's existing completion menus)
- Suggestions would be ordered by:
  - Recency of use
  - Frequency of use
  - Context relevance (based on partially typed command)

## Implementation Approach
This would leverage Nushell's existing infrastructure:
- Custom commands for database operations
- Hooks system for command interception
- Keybinding configuration for trigger setup
- Menu system for displaying completions
