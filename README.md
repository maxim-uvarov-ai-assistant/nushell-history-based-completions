# History-Based Command Completion for Nushell

## Overview
A custom keybinding that triggers completions based solely on my command history—analyzing previously executed commands to offer personalized suggestions.

## Key Difference from Existing Solutions
Unlike Carapace which shows all possible flags, this system only suggests options I've actually used. No overwhelming lists of every available flag—just my personal usage patterns.

## Implementation

### Database Structure
- Hook on each command execution parses and stores components
- Separate SQLite table with:
  - `history_item_id` (foreign key to existing history)
  - `command_name` (e.g., "ls", "git")
  - `flag` (switches) (e.g., "--all", "-v")
  - `parameter_name` (named parameters) (e.g., "--output", "--age")
  - `parameter_value` (values for named parameters) (e.g., "filename", "25")
  - `positional_arg` (positional arguments) (e.g., "arg1", "arg2")
  - `arg_position` (1, 2, 3...)

### Completion Menu
- Custom keybinding triggers database query
- Results ordered by recency and frequency
- Displayed in Nushell's menu system

### What Gets Tracked
- Command names and usage frequency
- Flags/switches (boolean options like `--verbose`, `-v`)
- Named parameters with their values (`--output file.txt`)
- Positional arguments and their positions (`cmd arg1 arg2`)
- Pipeline patterns
